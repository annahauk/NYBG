# NYBG IMAGE CLASSIFIERðŸŒ±
For my Break Through Tech AI Spring AI Studio project, we partnered with New York Botanical Garden to create an Image Classifier to correctly identify and sort the XXX number of specimens into the 10 image classes. 
## 10 Image classes
- Biocultural Specimens: Human made objects; brooms, carpets, etc.
- sme
- qsk
- nas
- am
- mkqs

Our most accurate model lies in the 'epoch.ipynb' file. We achieved an accuracy score over 90% and utilized a Tensorflow Xception Model. This competition was sourced through kaggle and you can find my team's submission here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bttai-nybg-2024/overview

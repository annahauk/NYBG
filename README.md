# NYBG IMAGE CLASSIFIERðŸŒ±
For my Break Through Tech AI Spring AI Studio project, we partnered with New York Botanical Garden to create an Image Classifier to correctly identify and sort the 122,880 samples of specimens into the 10 image classes.

## 10 Image classes
1. Occuluded Specimens
2. Microscope Slides
3. Illustrations (Color)
4. Animal Specimens
5. Live Plants
6. Biocultural Specimens: Human made objects; brooms, carpets, etc.
7. Illustrations (Gray)
8. Mixed Pressed Specimens
9. Ordinary Pressed Specimens
10. Micrographs Transmission Light

Our most accurate model lies in the 'epoch.ipynb' file. Through a Tensorflow Xception Model, we achieved an accuracy score over 90%. This competition was sourced through kaggle and you can find my team's submission here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bttai-nybg-2024/overview
